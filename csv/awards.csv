Johnny Depp is one of the most prominent and talented actors working today. The award-winning characters he consistently brings to life through film are uniquely enhanced with make-up and hair stylist artistry. Beginning with Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands in 1990, Depp repeatedly creates indelible characterizations, making it hard to imagine any other actor in these roles. His iconic performances in Sleepy Hollow, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Alice in Wonderland; and of course the continuing Pirates of the Caribbean series, are among the 50 plus roles he has played, which have been brought to life in partnership with his gifted make-up artists and hair stylists."

""Wall Street greed and its reverberating effects on the U.S. economy offer a modern backdrop for director Adam McKay's smart and funny film The Big Short, adapted from the best-selling book by Michael Lewis,"" said Film Festival Chairman Harold Matzner. ""Taking a complicated subject - the 2008 subprime mortgage bond crisis - McKay and his perfectly cast stars weave an engaging comedic story of a group of oddball money managers who see the train wreck coming and conspire to benefit. For this wildly entertaining ride and the fine group of actors who propel it along, the Palm Springs International Film Festival presents The Big Short with its Ensemble Performance Award."""

From the beginning of the program with Bruce Springsteen singing ""My City in Ruins"" to the closing moments with Willy Nelson leading a panoply of stars in singing ""America, the Beautiful,"" America: A Tribute to Heroes is an exceptional salute to those lost in the events of September 11, 2001. Bare stages lit with hundreds of candles in New York, Los Angeles, and London provided the somber, unadorned setting for this unique program carried live, commercial free, by more than 30 radio, television and cable networks, including ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, PBS, UPN, the WB, BET, Comedy Central, Court TV, the Discovery Channel, E!, Fox Family, FX, HBO, HBO Latino, Lifetime, MTV, PAX, Showtime, Sundance Channel, Telemundo, TLC, TNN, TNT, Univision, and VH-1. A number of Westwood One and Clear Channel Communications radio affiliates also simulcast the special telethon, which raised more than $150 million for the victims of 9/11. Leading this unprecedented cross-network effort was Executive Producer and Director Joel Gallen, Coordinating Producers Michael Dempsey and Carol Donovan, Director Beth McCarthy, and Writers David Wild, Peggy Noonan, Phil Rosenthal, Bob Shrum, Anne Lewis, Eli Attie, Tom Fontana, Chris Connelly, Terry Edmonds, Marshall Herskovitz, Ed Zwick, David Leaf, Gene Pack and Bill Clark. Moving musical numbers alternated with equally moving tributes. Those performing included Springsteen, Tom Hanks, Stevie Wonder featuring Take 6, George Clooney, U2, Will Smith, Muhammad Ali, Faith Hill, Kelsey Grammer, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Jim Carrey, Enrique Iglesias, Neil Young, Cameron Diaz, Alicia Keys, Robin Williams, Limp Bizkit with John Rzeznik of The Goo Goo Dolls, Dennis Franz, Jimmy Smits, Billy Joel, Calista Flockhart and Dixie Chicks. All involved donated their talent and time, while ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX underwrote costs surrounding the production of this outpouring of honor for those lost on Sept. 11, 2001."

From the beginning of the program with Bruce Springsteen singing ""My City in Ruins"" to the closing moments with Willy Nelson leading a panoply of stars in singing ""America, the Beautiful,"" America: A Tribute to Heroes is an exceptional salute to those lost in the events of September 11, 2001. Bare stages lit with hundreds of candles in New York, Los Angeles, and London provided the somber, unadorned setting for this unique program carried live, commercial free, by more than 30 radio, television and cable networks, including ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, PBS, UPN, the WB, BET, Comedy Central, Court TV, the Discovery Channel, E!, Fox Family, FX, HBO, HBO Latino, Lifetime, MTV, PAX, Showtime, Sundance Channel, Telemundo, TLC, TNN, TNT, Univision, and VH-1. A number of Westwood One and Clear Channel Communications radio affiliates also simulcast the special telethon, which raised more than $150 million for the victims of 9/11. Leading this unprecedented cross-network effort was Executive Producer and Director Joel Gallen, Coordinating Producers Michael Dempsey and Carol Donovan, Director Beth McCarthy, and Writers David Wild, Peggy Noonan, Phil Rosenthal, Bob Shrum, Anne Lewis, Eli Attie, Tom Fontana, Chris Connelly, Terry Edmonds, Marshall Herskovitz, Ed Zwick, David Leaf, Gene Pack and Bill Clark. Moving musical numbers alternated with equally moving tributes. Those performing included Springsteen, Tom Hanks, Stevie Wonder featuring Take 6, George Clooney, U2, Will Smith, Muhammad Ali, Faith Hill, Kelsey Grammer, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Jim Carrey, Enrique Iglesias, Neil Young, Cameron Diaz, Alicia Keys, Robin Williams, Limp Bizkit with John Rzeznik of The Goo Goo Dolls, Dennis Franz, Jimmy Smits, Billy Joel, Calista Flockhart and Dixie Chicks. All involved donated their talent and time, while ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX underwrote costs surrounding the production of this outpouring of honor for those lost on Sept. 11, 2001."

""Wall Street greed and its reverberating effects on the U.S. economy offer a modern backdrop for director Adam McKay's smart and funny film The Big Short, adapted from the best-selling book by Michael Lewis,"" said Film Festival Chairman Harold Matzner. ""Taking a complicated subject - the 2008 subprime mortgage bond crisis - McKay and his perfectly cast stars weave an engaging comedic story of a group of oddball money managers who see the train wreck coming and conspire to benefit. For this wildly entertaining ride and the fine group of actors who propel it along, the Palm Springs International Film Festival presents The Big Short with its Ensemble Performance Award."""

In a remarkable feat that vividly illustrates the range of his talent, this year he portrayed two real life characters, each a powerhouse performance in its own right. In the film Captain Phillips, he plays Richard Phillips, the captain of a ship hijacked by pirates, while in Saving Mr. Banks he plays Walt Disney trying to turn the book Mary Poppins into a film - two roles that couldn't be more divergent."

""Will Smith's status as one of the world's biggest box office stars has never obscured his strengths as one of American cinema's finest actors, a point not lost on Oscar voters who've nominated Smith as Best Actor twice, for 'Ali' and 'The Pursuit of Happyness.' His penchant for taking on tough thesping assignments won't surprise those who've paid attention to Smith's range, which was vividly on display from the beginning of his career. While still cutting his comedic teeth on the breakout TV hit 'Fresh Prince of Bel Air,' 25 years ago, Smith was stepping up to acting challenges in dramas such as 'Where The Day Takes You' and the complex central role of Paul in the film version of John Guare's Pulitzer Prize-nominated 'Six Degrees of Separation.' With this year's 'Concussion' Smith rings true as real life Dr. Bennet Omalu, the David to the National Football League's Goliath, a role very much in the tradition of James Stewart's famed 'Mr. Smith' and Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch."

From the beginning of the program with Bruce Springsteen singing ""My City in Ruins"" to the closing moments with Willy Nelson leading a panoply of stars in singing ""America, the Beautiful,"" America: A Tribute to Heroes is an exceptional salute to those lost in the events of September 11, 2001. Bare stages lit with hundreds of candles in New York, Los Angeles, and London provided the somber, unadorned setting for this unique program carried live, commercial free, by more than 30 radio, television and cable networks, including ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, PBS, UPN, the WB, BET, Comedy Central, Court TV, the Discovery Channel, E!, Fox Family, FX, HBO, HBO Latino, Lifetime, MTV, PAX, Showtime, Sundance Channel, Telemundo, TLC, TNN, TNT, Univision, and VH-1. A number of Westwood One and Clear Channel Communications radio affiliates also simulcast the special telethon, which raised more than $150 million for the victims of 9/11. Leading this unprecedented cross-network effort was Executive Producer and Director Joel Gallen, Coordinating Producers Michael Dempsey and Carol Donovan, Director Beth McCarthy, and Writers David Wild, Peggy Noonan, Phil Rosenthal, Bob Shrum, Anne Lewis, Eli Attie, Tom Fontana, Chris Connelly, Terry Edmonds, Marshall Herskovitz, Ed Zwick, David Leaf, Gene Pack and Bill Clark. Moving musical numbers alternated with equally moving tributes. Those performing included Springsteen, Tom Hanks, Stevie Wonder featuring Take 6, George Clooney, U2, Will Smith, Muhammad Ali, Faith Hill, Kelsey Grammer, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Jim Carrey, Enrique Iglesias, Neil Young, Cameron Diaz, Alicia Keys, Robin Williams, Limp Bizkit with John Rzeznik of The Goo Goo Dolls, Dennis Franz, Jimmy Smits, Billy Joel, Calista Flockhart and Dixie Chicks. All involved donated their talent and time, while ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX underwrote costs surrounding the production of this outpouring of honor for those lost on Sept. 11, 2001."
